```
Visit `http://localhost:5500` (or the port shown) and start editing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

## 🛠 Customization Tips
- **Resume link:** replace `assets/Priyanshu_Soni_Resume.pdf` or update the hero `<a>` target.

- **Theme/spacing:** adjust variables and media queries in `style.css`.
- **Contact form:** swap the FormSubmit endpoint with your own backend/service if needed.
